## Requirements
* Mozilla Firefox or any of its forks
* Userchrome settings enabled

## Features
* Replaces the Firefox Menu with the Overflow Menu
* Classic icons
* Toggle between OS themes
* Fully designable: includes a Windows 7 Metro concept, Windows 8 Developer Preview, Windows 8.1 Update 3, Windows 11 Metro concept and Windows 11 Fluent concept styles by default, or you can define your custom theme instead.
* Pin anything to the Charms Bar for easy access
* Switch between Win32 and Metro mode for the currently-focused program.
